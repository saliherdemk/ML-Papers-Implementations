# Artifical Intelligence
This repository has some of the paper implementations I’ve worked on. I started organizing them chronologically, but some of the early papers aren’t that easy to implement directly. A lot of the older papers don’t have the formulas laid out like we’d use today and focus more on theory, which I’ve found pretty hard to understand.
